      <h3>ABOUT</h3>
      <p>Native to St. Louis, Missouri, I attended Iowa State University where I had the pleasure of interning at Hearst Magazines and obtaining a bachelors in apparel, merchandising, & design. I developed an interest in web development while customizing my <a href="https://www.amoristori.com">website</a>, but was only able to learn so much on my own.</p>
      <p>I share my journey with learning how to code with very little prior knowledge or technical skills. I encourage you to follow along as I detail my experiences as a complete beginner in the tech field and specifically the software development space.</p>

  <br><br><h2>BEING IN A CODING BOOTCAMP</h2><br><br>

  <main class="grid-2">

    <div class="grid-item-3">
      <h3>MY EXPERIENCE</h3>
      <p>This is my first time taking a bootcamp of any kind let alone a coding camp. So far, I've gained a better understanding of certain concepts and I'm starting to recognize the patterns in the code. I'm excited to see what my websites will look like by the end of the program and comparing it to the websites I am able to create now. The support and teaching has been next level and it's made me feel like learning software development won't be as difficult as when I was learning it on my own.</p>
              
      <h3>PROGRAM GOALS</h3>
      <p>By the end of the software development program I would like to have a solid foundation in coding websites. I hope to development skills beyond coding as well that will allow for me to explore tech jobs outside of web development in the tech space. Currently, I think I would like to become a front end web developer but I'm curious to see how I will feel by the end of the program after gaining more skills.</p><br>
